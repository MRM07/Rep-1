Need zero experience. You can set your own hours. You can work the areas you choose.,"1) The number one problem is the RATING SYSTEM. It is not transparent or fair to the customers or drivers. I recently checked my daily driver rating, I had only driven 5 passengers that entire day, The rating was at 3 out of 5 for the day. On each individual trip on the driver screen, the rating was at 5 out of 5. I'm left wondering how that is possible. The only explanation I can think of is that Uber is not being transparent....",income rating feel maintenance things miles passengers support pay team,pay car uber wear gas tear low vehicle driver time
The only pro is you can work whenever you like. ( same as Lyft ),Your hourly rate can vary from $10 to maybe $30 but that's not counting the wear and tear on your vehicle. The 5 star rating system is questionable. About 95% or more of your customers will not tip you because either they are unappreciative or because Uber says tip is already included. Lyft customers tip more way ofter than Uber customers. They expect you to wait 10 minutes for a customer before charging them.

Uber clients are very professional and friendly. Getting to know all of the hot spots around the city is a great time,"Uber has recently lowered the rates which means a cut in pay while they increased their share by 5%. Also, the app is unstable on busy nights. Saturday night for me was all about rebooting the app and the phone and giving rides for free. Also, they tell our clients that the tip is included when it's no where to be found on our statement.",income rating feel maintenance things miles passengers support pay team,pay car uber wear gas tear low vehicle driver time

"Uber allows for flexibility and independence. Drivers offer great customer service and drive when they want. The requirements of the position are simple. Keep a clean and safe car, know your city and how to get around, be an excellent driver, offer your passengers water, communicate respectfully, use the app, etc. Keep up insurance, vehicle inspections and health inspections. It is fun to meet new people everyday. It's...","Demand for Uber is greatest during the evening hours. Uber keeps adding various fees and adjusting the payment percentages. You can make a lot of money, but it is not consistent from one day to the next. There is no base pay to compensate for the drive time to and from pick up locations. We are supposed to deny tips by saying they are not required.

work when you want. You have control.,It is the worst company to work for. It does not care for its ICs. We are all independent contractors. The passengers can blackmail the drivers anytime by threatening to give bed ratings. Uber does not ask its drivers for explanation. It just pulls the plug. Drivers have no value. The drivers need to form a union. Do not let Uber push you around. The give customer discounts and that goes out of drivers pockets.

I liked the schedule flexibility.,"The co. is an almost total scam, dishonest has no interest in ever dealing directly with you and are only interested in ripping you off.  As an Uber driver one night they told me  I did not respond to 9 requests to pick up customers. I never saw any any of  those requests.  I had never had more than 3 customers in any one night before and they tell me I missed 9 calls. Impossible. These guys are crooks.
